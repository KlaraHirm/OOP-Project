# Starting template

This README will need to contain a description of your project, how to run it, how to set up the development environment, and who worked on it.
This information can be added throughout the course, except for the names of the group members.
Add your own name (do not add the names for others!) to the section below.

## Description of project

This is a todo application that allows users to create boards, lists, and cards to manage their tasks. The application is built using Java, Spring Boot, and JavaFx.

Users can create boards to organize their tasks, and each board can contain multiple lists. Each list can contain cards, which represent individual tasks. Users can assign tags to their cards for better clarity and move them between lists and within lists to order them by priority using drag and drop functionality. Each card can also have a description added to it to provide further context for the task.

The application also features an admin connection, which allows an administrator to access all the boards created within the system.

This application provides an easy and efficient way for users to manage their tasks and stay organized in their daily life.
