## Formative feedback for group 13 - Week 1

#### 1) Self-organization

Sufficient: The team contributed equally, but they sometimes waited for external input. I would suggest better preparation in the next meetings.

#### 2) Suggested Topics

Sufficient: All of the topics were covered, but sometimes the discussion focused for too long on matters of smaller priority. In the future, more attention should be paid to time limits.


### General suggestions:
- Read the Teamwork files;
- Make sure the speaking distribution is approximately equal;
- Be mindful of the time limit;
- Prioritise items. If something has low priority and can be solved after the meeting, move on to the next point.
